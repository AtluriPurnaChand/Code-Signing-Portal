# Summary of Previous Chat
- Reduced false positives in heuristic scanner.
- Removed duplicate/black Upload button; kept blue Upload.
- Added industry-style ClamAV scanning with fallback to heuristic.
- Implemented quarantine for infected files.
- Added optional Docker setup (later removed on your request).
- Final requirement: run via `python app.py` without Docker; keep quarantine inside project; enable upload only when scan passes.
